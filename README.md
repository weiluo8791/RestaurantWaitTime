# RestaurantWaitTime

Introduction
People often find out there will be long wait when they got to the restaurant. Sometime
you just don’t care which restaurant but to get a quick bite. It will be better if you can see
all the wait time in advance in your surrounding and just go to it. We will create a
restaurant wait time application that will provide user real time information about
surrounding restaurant wait time on a no reservation basis.

Summary
We shall call this project restaurant wait­time (RWW). This is intended for any user who
are looking for place to eat to know in advance about what is the current wait time for a
no reservation walk in. There will be 2 groups of user. First group ​ consists of the
restaurant owners/hosts who will update the wait time data via a REST API interface
from a restaurant client application. Second group consists of restaurant goer who are
using the user client application to search and retrieve the wait time data.
