Data 							Active_Food_Establishment.txt (All Restaurant from City of Boston Loaded in Azure SQL
Azure Swagger:						https://restaurantwaittime.azurewebsites.net/swagger/

To better test the restaurant I enabled code first migration and initializedthe database with data from all Boston restaurant.
I can do the code first migration on Azure and have it created the database and table however I can not figure out how to initialize the database over in Azure. 
So I did it on my local from reading a local text file source. Then from which I generated the SQL insert statement and copy and run in the SQL Server Object Explorer.
code first migration with the following 
>enable-migrations
>add-migration Initial
>update-database

I did not get as much done as I am hopping for. Current the project is just missing few piece. 
I did not have Web Job
I did not have Redis Cache
I did not have Notification Hubs
I did use Blob for logging 

I manage to finish all the Web API and most of the Client application. I did not do the registration piece 

1. run RestaurantClient you will see the what the resturant user going to use to update resturant information and
update wait time. There are no registration piece yet so I insert a test user haing my own idpUser. You can not do anything
until you log in. So you can log in with iqboss@gmail.com/wei8791 (I will change later and I do not use that account very much)
After log in you will see you restruant information. You can update any information there it will auo save. Click wait time
bring you to the screen where you can enter your restaurant wait time by party size you can also change the date and time.

2. Run the UserClient you will see what the user will see. It will first load the first 150 restaurant. I plan to go it with 
geo-location but couldn't so I just loaded a list there. From there you can click on each restaurant to see the wait time. Only 1 
restaurant is assoicated with 1 restaurant  (#7 restaurant ) so only that one will work. Click on it will show you the most updated
wait time from that restaurant. You can also log in (same iqboss@gmail.com/wei8791) then you will see a Subscription button. Click on it will 
show you what the user subscribed to. You can click on the restaurant again to see the wait time just like previously.

If you need any more information regrading the implemention and access to anything please let me know. I am really running time on this project 
but I really enjoyed the class.
